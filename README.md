# Contact_List_Management

Contacts list management is a management system that creates and manages a list of contacts for particular user on the web. It stores contact details like name, contact number, date of birth and some additional details like email, relation with the person etc.

This management system is same as the contacts application of the phone. A user can add a new contact, delete an existing contact, update a contact, and also search contacts. The frontend of the project shows the list of the contacts fetched from the database and contains a tab consisting of details like all contacts, search and about (which displays the summary of the project).
